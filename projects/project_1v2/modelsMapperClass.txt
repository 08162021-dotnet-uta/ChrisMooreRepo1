Timestamp 34:00 He put the mapper in Business logic layer

According to Mark in the Video the model mapping is for pulling into and pulling out of the database 
with the mapping methods

Take for instance the customer model mapper class below
Its mapping betwen Entity Framework Models and View Models (e.g., viewmodelCustomer.cs, viewmodelProduct.cs) Mark Created:

public static class ModelMapper
{
	//This method takes a customer and returns the mapping to a ViewModelCustomer

	
	public static public ViewModelCustomer CustomerToViewModelCustomer(Customer c)
	{
		ViewModelCustomer c1 = new ViewModelCustomer();
		c1.viewmodelfname = c.efmodelFirstName
		c1.viewmodellname = c.efmodelLastName

		return c1;
	}

	//This method takes a ViewModelCustomer and returns the mapping to a Customer
	public static public Customer CustomerToViewModelCustomer(ViewModelCustomer c)
	{
		Customer c1 = new Customer();
		c1.efmodelFirstName = c.viewmodelfname
		c1.efmodelLastName = c.viewmodellname

		return c1;
	}
