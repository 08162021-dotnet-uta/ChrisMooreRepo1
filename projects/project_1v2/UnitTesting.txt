Unit Testing is the process of providing code that is going to run specified methods or objects in code without having to run a debugger

Three parts of Unit Tests

# arrange = instance of the entity to test

# sut (subject under test)

# act = execute sut for data

actual (i.e., actual data being tested)

assert = 

Assert (making the assertion the data is not null)


The concept of running tests is part of TDD (Test Driven Development) --> aka Red Green Refactor
