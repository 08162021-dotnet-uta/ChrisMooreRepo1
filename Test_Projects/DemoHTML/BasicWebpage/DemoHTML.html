<!--Notes for HTML:
    Elements can be formmated inline, and have styles manually applied via style attribute
    Attributes are modifiers place inside the opening tag of an element.
    * It is a key-value pair
    * Some HTML tags of specific attributes
    * The four main attributes are: id, class, style, and title
    * > id - provides a document wide unique id for an element
    * > class - provides a way of classifying like elements, is not unique, 
        and can be shared among other elements,
    * > style - adds styling directly to an element
    * > title - used to attach subtextual explanation to an element
        Which is a text popup when hovering over something like a tab.
    Elements:
    <a></a> - provides an anchor tag to link to a webpage
    <ul</ul> - is an un ordered list tag that will display bullet points
    <li></li> - just a list tag used in ul and ol lists
    <ol></ol> - ordered list tag that displays a numbered list
    Forms: Allows users to enter data
      * Data is sent to the web server for processing or client side use to update the interface
      * A forms HTML is made up of 1 or more form controls, some elements give a form structure
      *

<!--Notes for CSS:
    Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is a language that describes the style that the browser will give
    HTML elements on screen.
    CSS rulesets are stored in a .css file called a style sheet.
    Internal CSS: applied inside the <style> element inside <head> section of the HTML document
    Inline CSS:
      * Used to apply unique style to a single element
      * Uses style attribute inside an elements opening tag
    Syntax
    * The selector points to the HTML element that you want to style
    * Its declaration block is bounded by curly braces {} that contains declarations seperated by a semi-colon;
    * Each declaration includes a CSS property name and value seperated by a colon.
    Pseudo-Selectors
    There are two type of Pseudo-Selectors - Class and Element.
    * Class Selectors - are used to define a special state of an element
    * > This can be to display a visited link or have an elements color change when hovering with the mouse pointer
    * Element Selector - is used to style specified parts of an element
    * > THis can be like the first letter or line of an element
    A pseudo-class is a keyword at the end of a CSS selector that is used to specify a style for
    the selected element in a certain state: ex. Mouse hovering or checked checkbox

<!--Notes for Javascript:
  
  JavaScript (JS) programming language conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
  JavaScript is a high-level language that is just-in-time compiled, has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

  Primitives:
  A primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) in javascript is data that is not an object.
  * There are 7 primitive data types in Javascript: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null
  * Primitives are passed by value in JS vs Objects which are passed by reference.
  * All primitives are immutable, i.e., they cannot be change/altered.
  * A variable assigned a primitive value maybe reassigned a new value, but the existing primitive value cannot be changed.
  * If a functions’ local variable has the same name as a variable outside the function, the local variable shadows the outer variable.

  Key takeaway: a primitive can be replaced, but not directly altered

  JSON:
  JSON(javascript Object Notation) - is used for data exchange.
  Two methods of JSON are: 
  * JSON.stringify() which converts objects into JSON. (note: The JSON string is called JSON-encoded/serialized/or stirngified object)
  * JSON.parse() convert JSON back into an object. (note: parse decodes a json string)

  Functions:
  A function can return a value at any point using return;.It can also return; without a value.
  Never place return data on a separate line. JS assumes a ; after the keyword return.
  In JavaScript, a function is considered a value.
  A Function Expression is created when program execution reaches its declaration. It is usable only from that moment onward.
  The lambda operator is used with a function accepting no args or multiple with the right side evaluating the expression then returnign the result
  An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE, pronounced “iffy”) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. It’s also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function
  A nested function can access variables declared inside it’s code block and inside it’s parent code block.

  A closure is a function enclosed with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). A closure gives access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function.

  If a variable is declared inside a code block {...}, it’s only visible inside that block.
