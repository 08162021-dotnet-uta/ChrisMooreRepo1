<!--Notes for CSS:
    Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) is a language that describes the style that the browser will give
    HTML elements on screen.
    CSS rulesets are stored in a .css file called a style sheet.
    Internal CSS: applied inside the the <style> element inside <head> section
    Inline CSS:
      * Used to apply unique style to a single element
      * Uses style attribute inside an elements opening tag
    Syntax
    * The selector points to the HTML element that you want to style
    * Its declaration block is bounded by curly braces {} that contains declarations seperated by a semi-colon;
    * Each declaration includes a CSS property name and value seperated by a colon.
    Pseudo-Selectors
    There are two type of Pseudo-Selectors - Class and Element.
    * Class Selectors - are used to define a special state of an element
    * > This can be to display a visited link or have an elements color change when hovering with the mouse pointer
    * Element Selector - is used to style specified parts of an element
    * > THis can be liek the first letter or lien of an element
    A pseudo-class is a keyword at the end of a CSS selector that is used to specify a style for
    the selected element in a certain state: ex. Mouse hovering or checked checkbox
